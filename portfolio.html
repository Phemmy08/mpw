                    <p>
                        The Aggregate Calculator is a user-friendly tool designed to streamline the process of calculating aggregate scores for screening results. It takes multiple inputs such as academic grades, test scores, and weightings, and computes an accurate final score based on predefined criteria. Built to reduce manual errors and save time, this calculator ensures transparency and efficiency in result processing.

                    <h3>Church Website  Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project involved designing and developing a modern, responsive website for a church. The website serves as a central hub for church activities, providing essential information such as service schedules, upcoming events, announcements, and a blog section for sharing inspirational content. It also includes features like a contact form, donation integration, and multimedia content (sermons, worship songs, etc.) to engage the congregation and visitors.
